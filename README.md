## Features:
* Can convert between number bases such as decimal, binary and hexadecimal
* Compute the root approximations of equations using the Bisection method, Newton Raphson method, Secant and the False Position method
* Displays in a tabular format the root of an equation during each iterative step.
* Can solve a system of linear equations using some well known methods such as Gauss Seidel (both complete and partial pivoting) etc..
* Just build and run and explore all the features for yourself. 

## Contributing:

If you'd like to contribute new features or fix an existing issue please open an issue to discuss it before beginning implementation.


## Setup:

### Command Line:
